Replaced ghost with the pumpkin from https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/halloween-pumpkin-4484260f38114ad0b78da570afc5116c

✍️ https://joyofcode.xyz/introduction-to-3d-with-svelte

and migrated to Sveltekit 2 and did a little re-jiggering to make it work as it is old code.

## 🛠️ Build

```bash
pnpm run build && pnpm run preview
```
and then deploy to Vercel.
